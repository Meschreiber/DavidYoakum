## Pair Programming Exercise

The main objective of this exercise is to get a better understanding of how candidates approach coding problems and their ability to defend and explain their decisions.

### Part I: HTML/CSS
*~15 minutes*

![CSS Mockup](https://github.com/algolia/cs-team-recruiting-resources/blob/master/playbook/pair-programming/css-mockup.png?raw=true)

Have the candidate walk through creating the markup and then the necessary CSS layout styles to match the provided mockup. In certain cases, it might make sense to guide candidates towards a better solution by pointing out cases where their solution would break.

### Part II: Javascript
*~30 minutes*

![To-do app](https://github.com/algolia/cs-team-recruiting-resources/blob/master/playbook/pair-programming/to-do-app.png?raw=true)

Work with the candidate to create a simple to-do app with the below requirements, starting from the provided markup / CSS. Candidates can use any framework/library (or vanilla JS!) with which they feel most comfortable.

1. Add the ability to enter to do items and display them below the input. Results should be added inside the existing `<ul>` in the following format: `<li><span>Text</span></li>`.

2. Add the ability to remove items from the results list. This should be accomplished by adding a `<button>` element as a sibling of the `<span>`.

3. Highlight any added to-do’s that contain the word “shopping” in the color red.

4. If there are more than 5 to-do’s, clear the list entirely (if there is too much to be done, I’d rather do none of it).

5. Add animation effects to the interactions to make the app feel more natural.
